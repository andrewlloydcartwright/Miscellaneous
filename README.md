# Miscellaneous
This is for all my miscellaneous/small-scale/WIPs

## CoinFlipper 
_CoinFlipper_ is a Java application that will allow you to flip a coin up to the MAX_INTEGER size allowed to test the pseudorandomness of the java.util.Random class. It has neatly formatted output for totals and for ratio comparisons.

## DiceRoller
_DiceRoller_ is a project for my CIS 285 class, where we worked with Swing/AWT to make a GUI display dice face images at (pseudo)random from an ImageIcon ArrayList.
